    "\"The Tip of the Iceberg\" (or \"Automatic for the people\") project has been an enriching experience that has equipped us with valuable skills and insights. It has deepened our passion for scientific exploration and environmental conservation and has left us with a sense of responsibility to contribute to the preservation and understanding of Antarctica's fragile ecosystem. It has allowed us to navigate the intricate waters of scientific computation and numerical analysis in the context of Antarctica's unique challenges. This endeavor has not only deepened our understanding of the subject matter but has also honed our problem-solving skills and expanded our technical proficiency. One of the most valuable aspects of this project has been the opportunity to develop and refine our report-writing skills. Crafting a comprehensive report that effectively communicates complex ideas is an essential skill in any scientific discipline. Through this project, we have learned to structure and present my findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that the significance of the work is readily apparent to others. Expanding our Python proficiency has been another highlight of this journey. Python's versatility and power as a programming language became evident as we created new functions and classes to address the unique challenges posed by Antarctica's extreme conditions. Discovering and leveraging Python libraries for scientific exploration has been an eye-opener. These skills will undoubtedly serve us well in future scientific endeavors and computational projects. Although we were struggling with the calculations for finding round-off and truncation errors in the begining but after going through the lectures as well as other solutions of the the nuances of numerical errors available in google, helped us well to explore round-off errors and truncation errors, which has been a thought-provoking experience. Antarctica's unforgiving environment demands precision in numerical computation, and we now have a deeper appreciation for the importance of managing these errors effectively in scientific research. If we can get additional data and do more data analysis about this project, use more functions precisely with good knowledge of python and finally compare each result with others then we are optimistic that the outcome will be more accurate which could be done in future.\n",
    "To conclude, this project has been a good experience for us. It was a satisfied group work. Moving forward in our academic and professional journey, we are carrying with us the lessons and experiences gained from this project, ready to face new challenges and opportunities with a greater sense of purpose and proficiency."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Tip of the Iceberg\" (or \"Automatic for the people\") project has not only sharpened our problem-solving abilities and elevated our technical competence but has also fostered the art of effective communication. Crafting meticulous reports that distill intricate concepts into digestible information has become second nature, ensuring that the significance of our work shines brightly. Our exploration of Python's capabilities has been a revelation, unveiling a powerful tool for innovation and data analysis. We've harnessed Python's versatility to confront the unique challenges of Antarctica, unlocking new avenues for scientific exploration. We have gone through (\"Python Functions Tutorial in Datacamp\") as well as (\"Libraries in python lectures in geeksforgeeks\") for learning more about python which helped us a lot in this project. We used some basic syntax in numpy library and how it helps in making arrays and doing necessary calculations efficiently. We also learnt matplotlib library and its use in making useful visualizations of data for better understanding. The discovery and utilization of Python libraries tailored to our needs have widened our horizons, setting the stage for future scientific pursuits and computational endeavors. This project has helped us understanding of how computers handle numbers; its limitations in maximum and minimum values and the machine precison in calculations. Delving into the subtleties of numerical errors, especially the unforgiving precision required in Antarctica's research, has left an indelible impression. We now appreciate more than ever the importance of error management in scientific research, where the margin for imprecision is slim. To get more knowledge about numerical errors, particularly, round-off error and truncation error, we went through some lecture and tutorials available in (\"kapilcaet and web.engr\"). We also read case studies of spill risk assesments regarding the tip of the iceberg which helped us to understand the behavior of iceberg in Antarctica and risk assessments used in environmental impact statements.\n",
    "Overall, this assignment helped us in getting familiarized with the pyhton languange and understand its basic objects, such as functions and classes in making a more efficient script. Besides, it also helped us to learn numerical calculation in python environment."
